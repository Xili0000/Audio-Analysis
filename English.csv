non-toxic,"It all took place in a matter of minutes. The moose looks young and didn't look angry until multiple skiers whizzing past him or her, taking video, calling out to one another and generally acting like idiots freaked him or her out.  

It's a damn shame this creature was killed. Makes me ill."
non-toxic,"Dumb analogy. Most beaches are watched by lifeguards. ""Idiots"" entering in conditions way over their heads are warned or rescued. The idiots who enter closed trails and get in way over their heads - most often with the idea to get some ""rad photos for the gram"" are the ones who put innocent lives in danger. The ocean has preventative options. Hiking on expert only or closed trails do not."
toxic,"Deplorable liar, hypocrite, demagogue of a militant ideology against the world in wrathful avarice-poisoned pursuit of oil and war profit, paid for in the blood and misery of innocent millions abroad and US domestic enslavement to US$19.978B in wrongful war debt. All on a false presence. The war criminals Cheney and Bush and their collaborators still go at large, still escape the justice of the Hague. It's an affront to civilization itself, and this clown-beast claims to represent the right side of history?"
toxic,"Personally, I regret immigrating to Canada, As a country, it sucks."
toxic,"More jealousy of smart college-educated people?  Seems so.  Ignorant people like you, RTHur can't handle complex information.  Seems Allie has you on a short leash.  You can't help but respond with continuing idiocy.  (BTW, do you know how stupid it looks to add 'lol' to your own post.  Every day you just appear dumber and dumber)"
toxic,"Live by the gun. Die by the gun. Same for stupidity. Gonna love the boring retirement life of 6 walls staring at you, schmuck."
toxic,"the real ""problem"" is that a bunch of morons actually believed that anyone could trust a thing that he says"
non-toxic,"If Americans had any self-respect Trump would be the object of a ridicule so vicious he wouldn't want to be seen in public anymore. But clearly this won't happen because Trump represents a segment of Americans who are like him: dishonest, creepy, ethically unclean, irredeemably corrupt. If America had some sort of minimum standard for citizenship, these people wouldn't qualify."
non-toxic,"You got sucker punched, so clearly all minority grievances are false or exaggerated. Sorry you got punched by some idiot, sorrier that you're using it as an excuse to be a bigot."
non-toxic,"Actually, no. Religion is not intended to defend pedophiles, only lunatic pedophiles are the ones attempting to defend themselves."
toxic,"Yeah it's stupid to have laws about stealing stuff also. I mean if thieves are going to use a gun in a robbery, who in their right mind thinks they are concerned about breaking property laws.

Pretty ignorant if you ask me."
toxic,"Idiots.
Making ""safe"" zones for the very people who make unsafe conditions, or did you morons not notice the waterfront park is being closed because of the actions these bums take?
OCCC is a safe zone. Use it."
non-toxic,Piece of shit
toxic,"Still another pivot to divert the heat away from yet another crook that this clown surrounds himself with, in this case Sessions. To say that 45 is unstable and delusional is a vast understatement."
non-toxic,Castrate him and give him a bamboo mani-pedi.
non-toxic,"You left out that you think he is a big, fat meanie, and dumb, stupid dumbskull, dumb, dumb, dumb!!"
non-toxic,"Oh, there's that tired old false dichotomy again.  

There's more than one way to build a building  --  the Bullitt Center has demonstrated that a large building can actually generate more energy than it consumes.

But you just go ahead and sneer  --  it's clearly great fun to be ignorant by choice."
non-toxic,"diplomatic chinese? are you really that stupid?  its called negotiating loser thats the trump way, get used to it cry baby"
non-toxic,Thank you so much for writing this.  This small group of people are extremely disruptive and hateful.  So many citizens are sick of the half truths they spread and their ad nauseum repeat of the same handful of things they are ticked off about.  They are absolutely ridiculous.
toxic,Stupid comment IMHO.
non-toxic,"What a show. Moral of the story, don't be a jihadist and go kill westerners in other countries and expect Canada to kindly kiss your posterior.

And please, if you hate the west, stay out of Canada, because it's a western country."
toxic,"I thought comments were closed is this another tool to censor?
They must have been pretty stupid to get caught in today environment."
non-toxic,"It is good and proactive of GO Transit to see if more could be done to prevent a similar tragedy. However just like another comment, I am amazed at how foolish people behave at times with moving vehicles. Drivers are no saints (especially the distracted driver idiots) but pedestrians need to be responsible too. I see every day pedestrians walking in front of cars expecting them to stop, pedestrians head to toe in black crossing between lights and invisible to drivers. Hopefully this tragedy can be avoided again but people need to act like responsible adults too."
non-toxic,"Hopefully he grows a brain and abandons his desire to legalize pot, getting our young people hooked on another drug.  He's a pathetic leader and has no common sense."
toxic,Go ahead do it...just pay their fare/hotel to Alaska....anything to look good on the oil field. Damn State.
non-toxic,"Dumb Dumb Donald is true to his word:

Making China Great Again!

(What a dumbass...)"
non-toxic,"Well gee Gary, all the insults about Trump are what you call decorum? Hater, misogynist, Islamaphobe,Liar, Cheat, Pervert, Sex offender, Racists, dude, it goes on and on. Thats our POTUS you're talking about, very civil indeed. The Stock Market is not WAY up?  Almost a million new jobs, isn't up? Industry coming back and building new , isn't up?  ISIS is getting their asses kicked, isn't up?  And the failing NYT is anything but conservative, they DO NOT give the opposition equal play.  To say Trump is incompetent is patently absurd. Incompetence doesn't make you a multi BILLIONAIRE, incompetence doesn't make you one of the most successful builders in the world either.  On top of that ""Mr Incompetent"" has only run for political office ONCE, and  he won the PRESIDENCY doing it! Incompetent? HA! If you'd take off those damn liberal blinders, maybe YOUR perspective will improve. G""day. PS. I really do appreciate you nominating me for both AG and Press Secretary."
toxic,"I would have agreed with you a year ago. But white nationalist clowns like this particular one actually win ""elections"" in such corrupt systems - you never know."
non-toxic,"I'm going to smoke pot just to make this fair. Ten years ago we had just as many stoners as we do today. DUH. For decades the police have had to be trained for impairment, which included pot. DUH. We have spent hundreds of billions of dollars on prohibition that empowered the black market, and caused crime to increase. yet a simpleton like you fails to grasp youre profound stupidity has lost the war on drugs, people no longer buy into your refer madness lies/propaganda, and it totally sucks to be you. On behalf of the stoners of Oregon, thank you for your ability to continue to humiliate yourself in public for our entertainment."
non-toxic,"Only one phrase springs to mind when reading this primary school dribble: ""cuckoo land"". 
At least we knew that in the Pink Panther movies, that Inspector Clouseau, (the bumbling Police Inspector) was a fictional character, but to have a real live one in our midst is fairly freaky. And on top of it, he actually believes what he sprouts. Hell, we must have collectively done some seriously bad things in our past to be packaged with this idiocy."
toxic,Only a total crook would do what these scumbag Libs are planning.
toxic,"""This woman is absolutely crazy.""

Yeah, that seemed clear just from the police report. The best case interpretation is that she was temporarily crazy, but in my experience ""temporarily"" crazy is an incredibly rare thing."
toxic,Perhaps if you are islamic state scum you are not worthy of the title?
non-toxic,"Rick:  I just posted numerous questions about YOU and YOUR sister, and YOU Flagged them.  So, YOU are a LIAR about the open book."
toxic,CUCK FUCKSHITCUNT
non-toxic,"Good on screen, classless idiot in life. He should stick with what his good at, and keep his mouth shut off screen."
non-toxic,"What an inaccurate, ignorant statement.  Even the biased Hawaiian Studies folks would not make that claim."
toxic,Goddammit guys. Get your act together! You were a breath of fresh air post Harper era but we're starting to smell the rot already. Are you advised by morons? How could Morneau be so tone deaf to something like this??? And worse is Trudeau defending the practice! Gawd....is the ethical bar now that low??? God help us all.
non-toxic,"Too bad you can't stay rested for the rest of my life.

Another useless post on your behalf"
non-toxic,"Get your head out of your ass, don young. Weed is not going to solve Alaska's money issues. Stay  focused on ANWR."
toxic,Good: perhaps Dunleavy should be expelled from the Senate for religious intolerance and stupidity in general: the little man is dangerous to himself and others!
non-toxic,"The country is something like 80% self identified Christians, so the odds are damn good.  Besides who else in this country seems to hate and/or fear Muslims, hint, it isn't the atheists."
non-toxic,"The abortion gospel makes women cheap, accessible, childless, and exchangeable to wicked men.  Belief systems which preach the Satanic abortion gospel also preach the ""moral goodness"" of promiscuity, homosexuality, prostitution, pornography, and trans gendering.  Only a belief system will claim to know what is morally good.  What underlying belief system ties these beliefs together?  Is it government sanctioned and taught to children in our public schools?"
non-toxic,"That's called reporting the news. Are you saying Trump is not a blatant attention seeker and media hog? Or that he hasn't attacked the media over and over?  As for ""inflammatory"" stories:   whats your definition of inflammatory? And why the sudden fake outrage? When the same - and far worse was done to Clinton - you and your fellow haters ate it up and regurgitated the foulness onto the comment pages without so much as a blink.  Hypocrite."
toxic,"The writer is a fool; that dangerous kind of fool who believes they are imbued with all the answers and all the solutions, and if only they can cajole, coerce, force, tax or manipulate everyone to do what they believe is correct, all will be well in the world. 

These fools are virtually always wrong.  It doesn't pay to be guided by fools."
toxic,"And he will continue to look like a complete IDIOT. That's ok, he's digging his own grave!"
toxic,"Yes indeed, smart Americans didn't drink that koolaid as you did.  Socialism sucks"
toxic,"They want to put those awful roundabouts on Franklin now, too? Damn it. Yet another area I'll have to avoid."
toxic,But our idiots in Congress want single payer.
toxic,Blowback from his birther bs. Suck it up and get to work.
toxic,Maybe people that live in the Midwest should have to pay when a tornado levels their home.  You stupid mf.  Bet you don't own a damn thing is your pathetic shitty life
non-toxic,"Yay, you and your dumb pResident get a gold star. Now what?"
non-toxic,"And do you define ""solid proof'? Outside of mathematics and physics (correct me if there are others) you can never have definitive 'proof' of anything.

You can have evidence and in this case there seems to be many converging threads of evidence. The question is, why is all this evidence appearing in the political discourse now? Some people think that it's because Obama's a sore loser, or the intelligence communities want to embarass Trump, or they are simply inept. 

My theory is simpler. There is evidence because the attempt to influence the election was real and the dividends the Russians will accrue as a result are considerable. They aren't stupid."
toxic,"Ridiculous nonsense. This is a simple case of ""gimme a hand out"". Both authors attend Wits. So they want the best for themselves but are not prepared to pay for the best. Surprise, surprise...state funding is only a small portion of the budgets of universities like Wits. In order to offer quality education much more is needed. Someone must pay for that - but apparently these freeloaders do not want to contribute."
non-toxic,these types of beliefs are why america has become a fucking cesspool of selfish filth and greed but this turd will be flushed like the rest.
non-toxic,Because our government is screwed up
toxic,"Are u stupid... did you not read article small amount of Marijuana...... massive amounts of meth and herion .... yep blame it on weed.... you obviously  never smoked any. If so you would realize a ""reffer"" head would have been to lazy and hungry to steal a boat.. as a matter of fact. I guarantee  alcohol  which is legal same as Marijuana  played huge part in this... not defending the meth heads or tweakers out there,  but really your simple minded antics are what is wrong with our community..."
toxic,"This woman is disgusting. Make the ignorant voters think there's a positive, to ensure she returns to power. This is nothing more than vote buying. Notice that she'll be in retirement by the time the clueless, well, clue in. Oh my God. 

Fire her now. Don't vote Liberal anymore."
toxic,What a knucklehead. How can anyone not know this would be offensive??
non-toxic,Impossible.  You are embarrasing yourself here Klens75.  Best bow out now before more people laugh at you.....maybe they will start imposing duting on the GM plants in the America too...idiot.
toxic,To the Chinese Trudeau is a useful idiot.
toxic,NANA is a whore for Trump.
toxic,I say it's high time the G&M got rid of this pompous so called columnist full of sour grapes who continues to write nonsense.  Get over it: Trump won and we'll have at least four years of him.  Let's move on.  This whining based on expectations of the doomsday scenario is nauseating!
toxic,"The Leftnut media, NYT, WaPo, CNN, MessNBC, are all liars, traitors and crooks.  They have only one agenda: hate and kill Republicans.  They have no other function in life.  Sad, pathetic, but criminally liable.  Jail them all!"
toxic,He wants to go help terrorists then just ship him to Syria and be done with him.
non-toxic,"Spot on, screw the locals."
toxic,That idiot doctor got millions.. why settle for $30?  Ann sue the shiite out of this crappy airline.
toxic,Stupid kine popo.
toxic,The usual left wing loonies - ho hum
non-toxic,"What are we supposed to watch, CNN ? What an idiotic statement. Are you actually insinuating CNN and MSNBC are ""objective"" ?"
non-toxic,"There are two very important factors to take from this .... one is that the anc(another new corruption can not self correct but that they are self destructing!! ..... and two is that the anc has no real vision, mission or plan for themselves or the country. If they had they could galvanize the party behind it, but they have nothing. All that they have is everyone fighting amongst themselves for best position to maintain the looting game expecting the anc electorate to support them in the process. How stupid,! 
The country is in a jobs, growth, confidence crisis. Do you see any focus on this in this squabble?? It is all about them at the expense of the country!! How dumb can you be?."
toxic,What a stupid headline. Globe - please do better.
non-toxic,"Do not sign the petition to return Alaska to the poverty, illness, abuse and honey-buckets of the past.  Do not believe the lies from people how want to control you and hold you back.  Help develop a better future for Alaska with development, education, healthcare, jobs and optimism.  Do not sign the moronic petition."
toxic,Just another day in the Trump kleptocracy.
toxic,To live 71 years and have your life snuffed out by these 2 piles of shit is disgusting....
toxic,What has your body odor to do with anything you right wing idiot.
non-toxic,You all need to quit talking about shit that is irrelevant. What's relevant is that a beautiful young woman is gone. Say some prayers for her children that got left behind and her mother who is devastated. It doesn't matter what info the police released or didn't release. It's really none of anyone's business until it is determined what exactly happened. The register guard really needs to stop with the publicity shit as well and allow a mother to grieve for her daughter without constantly having that wound reopens. Have some respect .
toxic,One thing has become abundently clear ..... Paul Ryan is an idiot.
toxic,"yes the sky is still falling regardless of the propaganda, shell left taking 12 billion in investment out of alberta, thousands out of work and going no where,, the feds working with alberta to keep those out of work with thier hatred of resources!,, you are an idiot"
toxic,"Trump is definitely a worthless stain on America.
He's definitely a sick, fascist, white supremacist traitor."
non-toxic,"Annihilate means kill them all, not carpet bomb, bozo."
toxic,"Again, the argument for illegal immigration by CALLING it immigration.  Listen up nut jobs, immigration is not the problem. Its ILLEGAL immigration.  Quit saying immigration when talking about illegal immigration. Damn!"
toxic,"Thanks for confirming that Trump supporters are bigoted knuckle-draggers who are too stupid to understand that they've elected Nero, who is preparing to burn Rome and the common people in it, down."
toxic,Such venom and hatred.  You probably have a picture of Kathy Griffin in your room.  No cure for stuck on stupid.
toxic,"And when the city planners restrict access to improve safety, they get blamed for ""stupid"" designs that just cause traffic problems. 
It's a no-win scenario."
toxic,"I watch football to try and escape from crap like this.

Just shut up and play."
toxic,"testing purposes: 

you are an idiot and i can't stand ignorant donutholes."
toxic,"""The guy is completely bonkers.""

Well yes, but that has been apparent for some time now."
toxic,FUCK OFF AUTOPLAY.
toxic,Hard to feel sorry for folks who have been making State of Alaska union wages with over-sized health and retirement benefits but instead of preparing for the day when they would not be in the same position by saving money and eschewing expensive adult toys got themselves into debt. Now the rest of us pay for their childish greed and idiocy.
toxic,Juan Valdez are you stupid?  do you have any idea how the media is operated in real communist countries?  Please review the fact that ALL the news media in Russia is controlled by Putin.  Do you have any idea how the Chinese operate their media.  I can tell you that China and Russia do not report anything that is not approved by their leaders.   So what you are suggesting that you have no problem if Trump could approve all the news release?  We know one thing all ready Trump does lie a lot and he for some reason thinks people don't see through the lies.  Listening to his spokesmen try to rationalize his recent lies on the size of the the inauguration is funny but sad.
toxic,"Because of allie, I just might change my views on abortion, going from pro-life to pro-choice.  And with the other nuckle head liberals here, there is just no way to fix stupid."
non-toxic,You gotta hit the Americans where it hurts.
toxic,"I agree, Kim is just an attention whore."
non-toxic,"Have these clowns in Canadian government ever had a original thought since the first tax increase.  That is all every single one of them knows, tax and spend.  To think these same people hate Trump.  Voters are such fools."

non-toxic,"FACT: NOT ALL MUSLIMS ARE TERRORISTS, BUT ALL TERRORISTS ARE MUSLIM."
toxic,"Mulroney, you are a thief and a liar.

When are you going to pay back the $2,000,000 you stole from us to clear your 'good' name?

Thief! Liar!"
toxic,"Wow, the Liberals just keep marching on, one  ridiculous decision after another."
non-toxic,"Comparing Obama to Trump is laughable.  When you have video of Obama joking about having sex with his own daughter, let me know."
toxic,It's so stupid people can appear smart.  They need to get over themselves.
non-toxic,"typical liberal trolling left wing stupidity comment, if you bothered to read the news you would see a clear majority of canadians are in deed fed up with this illegal crossing bs and it is important to them!"
toxic,"Yes, I'm biased against the willfully ignorant.  I don't need anecdotal stories  from my running group, I just have to listen to the president and owner of the birther movement that rode a wave a hate,contempt and intolerance to the WH."
non-toxic,"trump is a disgusting porcine misogynist and now EVERYONE in the world knows it.

trump is HORRIBLE FOR AMERICA.

trump is FINISHED.  He's trash to be taken to the curb and DUMPED.

End of Story."
non-toxic,"So Alt-right excluded him and fellow Bernie Sanders supporters disavowed him-- gee, it sounds like no one wanted him, ""Frank.""  Man it sure sucks when you can't pigeon-hole him into your failed narrative, huh?"
toxic,petulant child
non-toxic,I see that you have joined the dumb group. How disappointing for a college professor!
toxic,"She doesn't understand what someone has to do to be impeached, and she thinks being impeached means booted out of the presidency.  She's a real idiot."
toxic,this is such a load of shit!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! maybe if it was their kids things would be different!
toxic,That is one of the stupidest ideas I have ever heard of and it figures it is Toronto and its NDP City Counsel. The stench coming from chicken poo is unbearable at the best of times but combine that with a hot summer day! I guess they want the new arrivals to think that they have all the good of the new world and for nostalgic measure the odors of the old world.
toxic,A discussion on Nextdoor got pretty testy the other day with claims that those of us who are concerned about illegal fireworks being told we were unpatriotic. Some of my neighbors are idiots.
toxic,Injustice served. Oregon has an insatiable need to constantly outdo itself when it comes to acts of stupidity.
non-toxic,"Steve L is awaiting your thought on his ""idiot"" comment."
toxic,"Yeah, this idiot is selling Canada to China. in the soon future, Canada will be controlled by fucking China."
toxic,The bastards grind on me when they try to put all the blame on Republicans only.
non-toxic,Republican White House plus republican senate plus republican house equals one big zero. The three ring circus tent is coming apart at the seams. You would get more cooperation from a bunch of kindergarteners. This is what you get when you give absolute power to a bunch of idiots.
toxic,How about we stop protecting idiots and let nature add some bleach to the gene pool. We can always submit their names for the Darwin awards.
toxic,"I bought a solar powered flashlight,darn thing doesn't work at night."
toxic,"G&M censorship system is the worst, plain stupid one."
toxic,that alright we don t need his crap up here
toxic,"Who is this movie made for? Movies like this are made for international audiences, mainly China. Same as the recent terrible movie The Mummy. Producers and film makers of these types of movies do not care at all about the North American box office. The box office is global now. Producers know these movies are garbage. But international audiences eat them up. ""Let them eat cake!"""
non-toxic,"-There's only one group of people on the planet beheading other people who do not believe as they do.

-There's only one group of people flying airliners into skyscrapers.
-There's only one group of people vowing to exterminate all other groups.
-There's only one group of people carrying out daily suicide bombings.
-There's only one group of people that strap bombs to their children and send them into crowded marketplaces to die and kill others. 
-There's only one group of people calling America ""the great Satan"" and vowing to kill Americans indiscriminately.
-There's only one group of people that have legalized pedophilia, honor killings of women and daughters, oppressing women, male guardianship of women, modesty dress codes, lack of marital rights, forced marriage, stoning deaths of homosexuals, women committing adultery, etc.

And that group is defended and supported by the Western Left (read Merkel, Hillary & Obama)"
non-toxic,"I am so tired of articles which praise Francis, while ignoring his inaction on the scandal, his positions regarding women, and his refusal to recognize that the position of the Church regarding gays is so terribly wrong."
toxic,Take your damn phone out of your ear in court.
toxic,It is Trump who is the terrorist.
non-toxic,"But he is.  

But really, #NotMyPresident is just as stupid if you're an American."
non-toxic,"Trump is his own worst enemy. 

I can't wait to hear Sean Spicer say that this is fake news and that Trump was clearly just helping him adjust his suit.  Then Trump will tweet out that he pushed to the front because America is number one.  And the whole media circus will run on overdrive until the next time he does something stupid."
toxic,"What is ""beer muscles with a side of fireball""?  Other than pure stupidity of course."
toxic,Reality is Putin has been punking Obama for eight years. Yup! The hacks are real but whats funny is the DNC knew about it a year earlier and were to Stupid to turn off their computers or unplug their servers LOL. Where was Obama's backbone with dealing with Russia concerning Crimea or the Ukraine? Obama handed Syria (and it's oil) to Putin who has established army/air bases and a navel port and flying sorties out of Iran. Thank god we have new leadership that will negotiate from a position of power NOT weakness...Turn off your computer...
toxic,You are beyond pathetic. Seriously. Have you any working brain cells? Just asking.
toxic,"You're being ridiculous. This system is no longer something that you can credibly repair with cast ballots. Haven't you been paying attention. Didn't you scrutinize the US 2016 General Election and the primaries that preceded it? Haven't you read about the military-spec Psychological Warfare that was conducted on the US electorate during this past election cycle? What part of money is not equal to speech, therefore Elections with money equal to speech are not credible liberal democracy hasn't yet been made sufficiently obvious to you yet? Are you waiting for some sort of supernatural indication?

This is off the rails, it's beyond democratic control because the system has failed. Now it's threatening everything: the country, peace, goodwill, humanity generally, credible justice, credible decency, credible government, credible hope. Wake up. Smell the coffee friend. We're wading up to our eyeballs in feces and it's getting deeper, you know."
non-toxic,"Republicans are hypocrites, but you knew that already."
non-toxic,"Some of us remember your cracked pot posts about Harper as obvious manifestations of Harper Derangement Syndrome.

And if you are going to post the same childish and stupid and tedious TDS accusation every time someone posts a negative comment - whether provable or just reasonable opinion - then it is obvious to all that YOU are the tiresome troll who needs to get some help.

I guess inasmuch as you are a left wing, Trudeau worshipping troll, you'll get away with this moronicity here.

Pity."

non-toxic,All the flat earthers have now created Civil Comments accounts. Let's brace ourselves for a second deluge of their nonsense!
toxic,Docs have been doing this for years. You wouldn't even want to know what they say and do during colonoscopies. These nurses were merely too stupid to keep their mouths shut- this happens all the time.

toxic,"Stupid travel doctors keep telling people to take this drug. I tried it once and the side effects were bad, inflammation, upset stomach and depression. Never took it again. Doc's kept telling me to take it when traveling.  I don't think it is much different than cloraquine. Doxy is another one that causes cancer, stupid doc's tell you to take that too. 
Malaria is a disease that can be cured in a few days, the important part is to be aware of the symptoms and take the drugs when you get a high fever."
toxic,"You mean Joshua Witt, who described the attack for Facebook but has not filed a polics report? Most news agencies report crimes filed by police departments, if he didn't report a crime, no one's really going to listen and the local news will generally overlook it. If he filed a report, it would be found under the Crime section of the News first. Nothing about a stabbing in Sheridan currently listed, but that could change. A cut that requires 3 stitches isn't really a knifing, that's closer to ""attacked by a drunk idiot"" headline."
non-toxic,"Let us know when you actually have any evidence.

non-toxic,Same place you got your silly stuff.
non-toxic,"Lets see, you say BCers are ""Selfish Liars"" and need to learn to ""compromise"".
So your idea of compromise is:

1) Alberta gets it's pipeline
2) Alberta gets to pipe toxic sludge into BC where all of it gets shipped out of the country
3) Alberta corporations get rich
4) BC gets a seven fold increase in tanker traffic
5) BC gets virtually all the risk when (not if since it WILL occur sooner or later) a pipeline breaks
6) BC gets to deal with destruction of the coastline when (again not if) a tanker leaks/breaks (with ""some"" help from the federal government but not as much as would be needed. It never is.). 
7) BC gets all the responsibility, work, and blame to clean up and restore fragile coastline ecosystems
8) BC gets to have it's major industries (tourism, coastal tours, whale watching, parkland vacationers, etc..) ruined with the damage and destruction of the coast

You can take your ""compromise"" and stuff it in your tar(sands) hole. You are the selfish liar."
toxic,"The problem with Trump's misogyny is that when he acts like a jerk, all the other jerks feel like they can act like one too.

But I refuse to allow you to shift accountability to me for your utter stupidity in choosing to vote for Trump.  That's on you.  Indeed, Trump is acting exactly as he did as a candidate.  He's an incompetent, sexually predatory, venal, bullying, boorish, ignorant, narcissistic, mentally unstable pathological liar and that hasn't changed. Why do you think liberals and democrats were and are so amazed that anyone would actually think he could lead our great nation, and vote for him? 
Look at him. Same bloviating sack of air who campaigned for president, surrounded by the same slimes he had with him on the campaign trail.  How many times Did Trumpnuts rebuff efforts to educate them? Countless times. I've had enough of stupid to last a lifetime."

A company took advantage, did a quick study on it, patented it, and raised the price 2000%.

non-toxic,"This makes no sense. Canada and Trudeau have already gotten their headlines for stepping up to the plate with compassion and virtue to take the refugees and others who are being impacted by the Trump travel ban.
No one is going to find out what you're doing with the Emerson 'problem'. Enough already with looking for a technicality to save face. It's not necessary.
This is similar to the theatrics of whether Canada should do the right thing and not sell billions of dollars of arms to the worst human rights violator in the world. No one found out you did that either, you get to keep the money and the  'peace loving honest broker' stuff.
Along the same lines, European countries marvel at the relative ease in which Canada can bring in tens of thousands of Syrians compared to the chaos in their own countries. What they don't know is the secret seems to be to limit the influx to orphans, families and homosexuals. You would be stupid to let that info out. You've already gotten your headlines."

Certainly those runs weren't all early and then abandoned. Passing didn't bring us back or even close for a last minute win, so what's the point, especially if poor passing/catching is digging the hole deeper. Not only were we passing from 30+ to 50 times (did McCoy mistake TS for PFM?), can you name a game last year or this year (excluding the 1st KC game in 2016 and we still lost that game!) where passing overcame being behind? Sorry, but it's widely known that a young QB's best weapon is a strong run game. We started 2017 with just that and our coaches saw fit to throw the following games onto Trevor's arm...

And yet, you are backing an idiot that is wasting 10s, if not 100s, of BILLIONS on this illegal issue and solving NOTHING. 
If we continue to go after individuals, there are 13-30 million illegals in America, with more coming every year. How many are we exporting? 
Turns out that we deport less than .5M / year, while more than that arrive. Worse, we are spending 3.2B on this. 

http://money.cnn.com/2017/04/13/news/economy/deportation-costs-undocumented-immigrant/index.html

And none of that includes his foolish wall.
OTOH, if we figure out who will get passes here, and then phase in e-verify, it will cost us less than 1B / year, and will deport the 9-22 million that do not fit the above idea of amnesty. And most will be gone within 2 years. Those that remain will be easy and cheap for ICE to capture.

This means he does not have the capacity for compassion and/or empathy, love and the understanding that we are interconnected and interdependent.  Sociopaths operate on adrenaline; the thrill of the adrenaline rush, power and conflict are what gets their interests and attention - it's about the only thing that does, since they don't have normal ""feelings."" Trump's tax plan would boost the wealthiest 1 percent- those who earn over $700,000.00 a year by about 13.5 percent.  The richest .1 percent would receive an average tax cut exceeding $1 million.  The middle income folks would receive an average $1,010.00 in tax cuts.  Trump is a typical lying politician; he says what he thinks people want to hear, then when elected, does what benefits him and his family.  Buyers remorse Trump voters?"

The bullet ricocheted off the trunk and out the window in the direction of people standing outside.  One of his fellow CATM members once thought he had cleared his weapon and so pulled the trigger.

The baseless charge eventually ensnared Oscar Chapman, Interior secretary under President Truman, who Schoeppel accused of lying in his oath of office.

Nixon won with dirty tricks and was tossed out on his ear. Nixon prolonged the war by stalling the peace talks, and thousands of additional US military died. But I see your point, Trump said he would get the US out of Afghanistan because he thought that would get him votes. So now, another campaign promise tossed into the circular file. No matter, his base will still love him. In the meantime the US will still be fighting a war of attrition against people who have a lifetime stake in their country. Pretty stupid."

Adolescent boys ate it up as it addressed their sexual fantasies. MSM loved it too, as they could sell more soap too. Once you are in the MSM, you are then a kind of immortal, insofar as media is involved, which is a separate ""world"" that ""conquers"" the actual world."

non-toxic,"in the article, Mr Martin uses Tom Nichols' book as a backdrop for his own words on Donald Trump and the state of America.  It would be difficult to discern from the article, but it might come as a surprise to those who think Mr Nichols is talking about a uniquely Conservative brand of stupid, that Tom Nichols is a life-long Republican. 

Nichols was vehemently opposed to Donald Trump during Trump's campaign and while publicly expressing immense distaste for Hillary Clinton, he argued that Republicans should vote for her rather than an individual he saw as fundamentally unfit for office. 

A simple review of Nichols' writings will show he doesn't restrict himself to conservative idiocy"

Trump was lying about a facelift, but she did have a chin tuck while she was there? I'm supposed to look at her face and believe that crap? C'mon, don't care. I'm sure they'll get a ratings bump, which was what the whole thing is about, then they can start a go-fund me campaign to pay for their wedding. The whole thing is stupid.

Should Trump be able to hold his water with such idiocy, yes, but he's not like that. Him being a jerk and not acting like other Presidents will not cause the downfall of this country. You are correct, he is mean spirited."

non-toxic,"Au contraire. We need to be much more willing to call ""lies"" on the people who are lying. 

Not doing so is why we are in this mess. Many of seem to have forgotten that The Donald rode into politics on the basis of one lie: that Barrack Obama was born in Kenya. It was proven as a lie almost from the outset, yet for some reason the media felt they needed to show respect for this clownish crook's verbal spew, so nobody ever called him the liar that he was and is. Meanwhile millions of fools were duped by his charade and now actually BELIEVE that Obama was a tyrannical Muslim, raised from an early age to rise to the Presidency and then impose Sharia law on our great and shining nation. 

So: RG, thank you for calling a lie a lie."

Trump's attempts to obstruct, now that the investigation follows the money, appears suspicious. If he's innocent, seems he would support an investigation to clear his name, and he likely wouldn't inquire about pardons for his aides, his family, and himself.

Kushner's testimony was ridiculous. Trump's senior advisor didn't even know the name of the attending Russian ambassador? And he didn't know the subject of the meeting, when the subject line clearly indicated its purpose? Why didn't Kushner disclose his contacts on his security clearance forms - his assistant's fault?

As a matter of fact the United States has been acting as a buffer since Canada does not have a border Mexico. Suck it up liberal Canadians. Let's see you walk the talk. I hope these illegal aliens keep swamping Canada.

Hillary is a murderer (seriously). By your logic that would mean Trump could be a rapist and it would not be a big deal.
If you want to talk politics like a child, go to the Sesame Street forum.

Second, I am not a fan of Bill Clinton. Bill Clinton got deferments just like Trump did except that Bill Clinton was eligible for the draft.

So by your logic, Trump is much worse than Clinton.

You want to talk about responsibility? Go ahead!

And the cruise missile attacks into Yemen to support the Saudis and the daily bombings in Iraq from Italy by our Air Force and from our aircraft carriers are also post-war atrocities.  

No.  Tom, the wars are not over, just being conducted with different weapons and fewer deaths---at least of our people.

The DA's office shouldn't care, nor should anyone else, if the case hangs over the defendant's head and is a burden to him...a man died at the hands of a man trained to use restraint and for not a good reason. realistically, however, if the deadlocked jury was at least 8 to 4 for guilty on the deadlocked charge, if not more, than it should be retried. even a public defender would concede that at that number the DA

As for the demonstration, it was your typical vague, feel-goody demo that passes for activism these days. Bereft of focus, it was just a grab-bag of complaints, much of which was unfair or out of context. Women in the West, for example, have the most freedoms and rights as of anywhere in the world. Yet, no attempt was made to protest true abuses of women these days, primarily taking place in the Islamic sphere. No mention of the sex slavery, or the brutal mass murder happening across the Middle East and Africa. 

Instead, protestors carried signs equating wearing hijabs and burkhas with feminism. Foolish or willing fools? Who knows but it certainly is not feminism."

The cause of Greenpeace remains noble. Big oil has nothing noble about it. Whether they are doing the right thing ought to be part of how we judge them. Cleaning up after a spill? The barest minimum. Extracting the biggest pollutant of the planet while the answers are staring us in the face? Stupidity. Their only motive is profit - regardless cost.

Oil and coal are not going to form part of the future energy needs of this planet. Renewables have passed parity in terms of cost, and prices are still in freefall. Storage of energy has also been addressed, and has become economically feasible. Global CO2 levels are skyrocketing, and oil and coal still want us to be NICE??"

He's such an incompetent jack*** that he manages to whiff on great big softballs thrown right over center plate - two I can think of - one was to come out and simply condemn ACTUAL NAZIS at Charlottesville. He totally failed on that. Huge whiff. Then, all he had to do was to make a phone call to a widow about her fallen husband, and he struck out on that, too. Even after it comes out what happened on that call, a better man would have asked how he could rectify things. Instead, just more bullying from this jack***. A complete loser, and a very little man.

Sometimes the Ds come up with a particularly attractive candidate that can win in some other districts and sometimes they put up candidates that sound more like conservatives than most Republicans do.

There were probably more guns in the crowd than in Paddock's hotel room.

*I put rights in quotes because even in America you don't have a right to carry a gun onto somebody else's private property without their permission. Open-Carry laws don't actually mean the owner of the local McDonalds has to allow you to scare kids with your massive penis-extension hanging out.

So in other words, the Liberals are the high priced call girls while the CPC were the less expensive street walkers?     Is THAT the difference?

Face it - ""cash for access"" is a sensationalist way to describe fundraising when a politician attends their own fundraiser.     It's been going on for as long as politicians needed money and there is nothing inherently wrong with it.    Further, eliminating it doesn't solve one damn thing."

I can tell you from my perspective, knowing Rod, that he wouldn't have been so ignorant as to point a firearm at a cop of all people.  My theory and it's biased,  because I hate police and have for a long time, is that he called the police to tell them this asshole was beating the shit out of his girlfriend and he, being a concealed weapons holder,  waited outside for the police to arrive with his weapon and then when they arrived instead of deescalating the situation probably shouted ""DROP THE GUN, DROP THE GUN~bam bam bam bam bam bam bam.  Seven shots.  Senseless.  The only conclusion I can come to is the fucking EPD dropped the ball again and shot another minority because that's what they do.

non-toxic,"I am a gay man, chaste & celibate, with ""tendencies"" rather than just an orientation or supposed ""disorder"", and a former priest. The dearth of celibate integrated fellow priests was largely why I left active ministry. My experience is that gay priests tend to be more sexually active than straight priests, although both (forgive the binary constructs) are at least periodically active and to a staggering extent. Solid accounts by rare seminary or chancery personnel underline this reality. Yes, concupiscence is a function of humanity, so let's start such conversations by being compassionate and, where required, forgiving. But we must also acknowledge that the sideways living of enough priests, and the bishops who manage them and who themselves live less than integrated lives, give cover to those in their ranks who engage in criminal, and not merely immoral, behavior. You're only as sick as your secrets; an elite hierarchy calling out this phenomenon as a disorder is more than ironic."

Any economy can grow by piling on debt. The Canadian dollar is being pumped up by the squeeze on earlier short sellers, and the speculators' belief that interest rates will continue to rise. I don't know what will happen, and no one knows. But one thing I do know is what goes up quickly goes down quickly as well. Look out below when the bottom drops out, not if but when. The fundamentals can only be submerged for so long. 

There will be those who believe otherwise. That the Canadian economy is just wonderful. But as another writer has pointed out, the Canadian stock market has gone nowhere one/ten years.

non-toxic,"Susie, you pathetic moron, show us proof that you and your uneducated rural ilk are ""paying for their, and all other illegal aliens healthcare, food, education, etc...""

You can't, because ""illegals"" are a net positive in US society. Check out the AFB American Farm Bureau data sometime. And get an education, you poor, pathetic kook. You're an ugly person inside and out (and probably claim to be Christian as well, what a laugh)."
non-toxic,"aa the usual left wing bs,, no one is supporting or asking for a zero an hour min wage, you lunatic, the free market will decide that because industries pay what they can and still make a profit. you see ignorant lefty,  no profit means the close the doors and all are out of work but thats ok with you lunatics in the end"
non-toxic,"Cleanup Eugene - All you do is troll Eugene/Springfield crime news reports & make comments. You trolled me over the death of my father. You seem to have something to say about every crime committed/reported in Lane County/Register Guard and that says more about you than it does the individuals in the headlines. Not really ""headlines"" since it's useless small town news, but we've already established you're pathetic. Get a life, dude."
non-toxic,I don't know how Brown can complain about gun violence and  push for these bills while she also wants to cut mental health support like the hospital in Junction City. It's incredibly hypocritical.
non-toxic,"Even a ""tiny-minded, hypocritical idiot"" knows that Trump made a pittance of his fortune this way.  He made his money in real estate."
non-toxic,Your 2nd most stupid comment but I am sure you will do better.
toxic,"Right wing nuts are stupid. Proven fact. Liberals, in the other hand, aren't. 
I guess that makes them a little harder to fool and control, eh, Herr Fuhrer?"
toxic,"At least he didn't say something truly vile like ""I want to grab her pussy"". President Trump!!!!"
toxic,There's a sucker born every minute...
toxic,"Thank you Secretary Mnuchin!
Do not let the hypocrites win."
non-toxic,The screwing you get for the screwing you got.
toxic,too many stupid humans on the planet time to cull the herd.
toxic,"No they won't 40 mayors across BC oppose the stupid, reckless and dangerous crude export."
toxic,"Morrissey may be a bit of a jerk,  but he had the nads to say what needs to be said!"
non-toxic,"Trump doesn't want to be a dictator...he is a dictator.  He has a legislative branch with his own party holding a majority; that does not want to ever reign in this person's megalomania.  He foments the innate fears of middle America - racism, economic and social prejudices, and lays blame at the steps of anyone who speaks out or stands against him.  For those saying that its refreshing that he is saying what's on his mind, that's like saying Hitler was great because he made it clear exactly what his final solution was to the ""Jewish Problem"".  The sad part?  Someone like Trump from his social background, has little love for the average white male that espouses Trump's platform and racially charged diatribes."
non-toxic,"Well gosh darn it!  I worried about the unknown costs, unknown fare price, unknown power source and costs, reasons why this project was ""sold to us"" as $5 Billion versus the actual cost probably 3 times that, and a potentially perpetual rail tax that won't be enough for the O & M.

After reading your article I feel much better.........and know that everything's under control."
non-toxic,"NO it is NOT STUPID! WHAT IS STUPID IS our damn dependence on oil coal!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
its damn time to BREAK free from fossil fuels!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
non-toxic,My first thought was to fry all the people involved. But now I think they should be kept alive so they enjoy getting beat up and raped on a regular basis why they serve life prison sentences.
toxic,Damn that Obama!
non-toxic,no...dumb old chump is a bull in china shop.  pigheaded narcissistic  obtuseness should not be mistaken for courage.
non-toxic,"ibbitson in clearly a lib trolling hack now, the senate is a joke it just caved to justin rather than stand its ground, what a useless bunch of paid losers"
non-toxic,This is why people have shotguns ready for losers who are stupid enough to try these stunts. A better ending would have been if the victim had blown the perps heads off.
non-toxic,"With friends like this, who needs enemies?  I would never consider mcconnell reasonable, but in comparison to trump....  The ignorant buffoon currently occupying the white house doesn't even understand the complexities of health care, as he so clearly stated.  In fact, he understands very little of what a potus should know.  Sad and pathetic!"
toxic,And countless idiots not wearing their seatbelts.
non-toxic,"if by better things to do you mean, continue to be ignorant of any given issue your posting on...I believe that. PR has been widely reported on for decades now. I am not surprised your imaginary 125 IQ could not manage a simple google search on the subject. and thank you for moving on and stop wasting my time with your babbling ridiculous nonsense."
toxic,"Here are your ""cites""; Donald Trump is president.

Apparently watching the events unfold in real time in full color isn't enough proof for you and your ilk so the remaining sane people in this country just ""cited"" their evidence. 

please go back to that moist dark rock you live under.

D or R, if what she did and said after Benghazi doesn't incense you there is something fundamentally wrong with you. ...and if it had happened under GWB your opinion would be 180 from what it is. that makes you a super hypocrite."
non-toxic,"I swear Joe has 2 left feet. He gets in his own way. It's always such stupid BS with this guy. Like the BS with the state computers, petty, stupid crap."
toxic,"Eligible Americans appear to enjoy Medicaid, Medicare, Social Security, Unemployment Benefits, Workers' Comp., Corbel; and so will you when and if you live long enough to enjoy the first three federal bennies.  Stop being a hypocrite."
non-toxic,Pruitt shouldn't be allowed to meet with other Environmental Administrators. Those that have the job in other countries actually CARE about the environment. Pruitt is doing everything in his power to trash ours. Favoring polluters over citizens. He is an embarrassment and a danger to our health.
non-toxic,"That's silly. very little of modern life, which is regulated by the constitution was directly addressed by that document. What you are claiming is that religion takes precedence over any other consideration. Sort of a Christian Sharia, amirite? 

So if Jews are considered as Christ killers, is it o.k. to discriminate against them? If a muslim decides to discriminate against women, it that o.k.?"
non-toxic,"Perhaps you can clarify where I mentioned that the school should make them read those books. Seriously, who argues against hoping kids read great literature? 

Buy yeah, I think kids reading the bible is silly."
non-toxic,"It means the racists in da village dont want white trash hunting "" their"" caribou."
toxic,"So, no Jewish immigrants? No Seventh-Day Adventists, or other fundamentalist Christian sects who prohibit pork? No vegetarians regardless of origin?

So much ignorance and bigotry. Pathetic."
non-toxic,The DOW is up because trump appointed the top dogs from Goldman Sachs to run the financial offices of his administration. Seems like only yesterday that Clinton was being hammered for giving speeches to Goldman Sachs conventions but now you and your fellow travelers are mute about the buffoon filling his cabinet with the very billionaires and lobbyists he said he would rid DC of. What's up with that hypocrisy deplorable?
toxic,"Well, GW Bush has been mocked for being rather stupid.  Perhaps its true considering that he hired Michael Gerson."
toxic,"Try thinking before you type, it makes you appear less foolish."
non-toxic,"Check Wayne Easter MP tweets against White House, Jeepers? Can the  Trudeau ""Team"" be any more laden with morons?"
non-toxic,"you are nuts! there are plenty of unemployed skilled poeple with no work to go to,  in 10 of 15 years if things turn around great bring them in , such in the mean time NO! , the economy and jobs have been decimated by the scams of ontaro liberals for one thing! Carbon taxes hurt everyone and for no dam good reason. it is not necessary, get educated. , the activist say so not scientist. the usa now with the gop and trump will ignore them completely over this nonsense while we push ahead and make ourselves less competitive and hurt our consumers. in 4 years the usa will be soaring and enough people will wake up to the complete disaster of a direction the likes of wynne and trudeau are taking us. as for your arrogant finish, with the enjoy comment, yet proving again why the left are corrupt arrogant trash"
toxic,"Be careful what you wish for, Garrison. You are a fool."
non-toxic,Shooting at others is not speech. Trying to compare shooting at people to speach is beyond stupid.
toxic,"By heavens they are stupid and proud of it! Wait for the inevitable ""Poor us, we've been victimized by those godless liberals."" whining when they lose."
toxic,"I don't care who it demeans, Trump is nuts."
toxic,a smart phone in every students hand and free wifi. nothing else is needed except teachers that can teach kids how to use the apps available for free. my granddaughter goes to one of the best private fourth grades in hawaii and she is not allowed to have her phone on much less use it for class. ignorant adults = ignorant kids.
toxic,"he sounds like a moron...and to solidify  that impression, he talks about toradol like it is cocaine...it's not, dude!..it is a step up from advil or motrin, not some 'orgasmic' illegal drug!
once a douchebag, always a douchebag..."
toxic,"Alaska wilderness - 1
Idiot - 0"
toxic,"According to the Harbor Master in a CNN interview, the dock has multiple signs warning visitors to not feed the migrating sea lions and that they are wild animals and should be treated as such. He also commented, 'You can't legislate stupid.'"
non-toxic,Gay folk don't define themselves by sexual acts any more than heterosexuals to. It is the sodomy-obsessed gay-haters who try to impose such a definition.
non-toxic,Go and enjoy Sidney.  Don't listen to all the bs.   The world has gone absolutely mad.  Ignore it.
toxic,some clown using the pseudonym jangm gives you a like on a comment calling someone out for hiding behind a pseudonym?
toxic,Brent. I think teachers are some of the most overrated and overpaid individuals on the face of this earth. You pass your liberal lifestyles onto a mindless group of rug rats who have not yet learned that the liberal lifestyle is destroying our country. You are only there to spread your liberal beliefs. This is something the liberal Democrats have pushed for years. Indoctrinate the young while they are ignorant. Promise them that the government is their true parent and will take care of them for the rest of their lives. Womb to the tomb coverage.
non-toxic,Kick her in the stomach Angela! Then punch her in the face. Try to do as much physical damage as you can to the girl. Yeaaaaaa! Smash her nose...
toxic,"Don't forget Trump Chumps are proven idiots. For example, assuming a convicted felon like say, Nelson Mandela or Ghanaian did poor quality work and made questionable arguments. 

Of course, Trump Chumps have nothing to recommend them, so it's important to them to find anything, something, no matter how small or irrelevant, with which to bully someone. 

You can't fix stupid."
toxic,"Yes, this is the problem. Guys finding liquid courage to do stupid things."
non-toxic,"You are a delusional fool.  Not even an entertaining one.  Your are uninformed, paranoid and incapable of original thought.  In other words, a typical Trump supporter.  But come November, you lose."
toxic,"What idiots, both of them.
1. You don't ride a motor scooter on the sidewalk.
2. You don't flash fire arms.
3. You don't lay down in front of a moving motor vehicle, anywhere. That's just dumb, and then grab a loaded gun. Guttzie but dumb."
toxic,There's a third option: they're just plain stupid. I believe that covers about 90% of those types of postings.
non-toxic,And marijuana is illegal under federal law. Now what? Somewhere masturbation is probably illegal. Now what?
toxic,"So great. You heard it from the horse's mouth, people. At least when this next 4 seasons of racist, bigoted reality TV is over, nobody on the right will be able to point fingers. Oh wait, yeah, they'll still point fingers while regurgitating fake news stories and belittling people. This country is full of idiots. At least half full anyway...."
toxic,Paulie.... is that supposed to be an attempt at cuteness or just stupidity.
toxic,"Ah, the conservative right-wing politically disingenuous ploy, don't like the messenger, so shoot the messenger."
non-toxic,"Why thank you for your vey civil remark.  I agree that I was a tool for spending the majority of my adult life defending your right to call me a tool.  Now the real question is.,..would you call me that to my face?  Nope,  because you are nothing but a troll and a coward"
toxic,"Botanist.  Why do the idiots always bring politics and presidential candidates into the conversations?   
Let's see,  I'll answer my own question.     
Answer:   gullibility, stupidity, and living vicariously through the internet."
non-toxic,"Here are ten misused words that make a stupid person look even more stupid:

""My sorrow is deep, Cuba's larger than life leader died"".

Are you reading this, Justin?"
non-toxic,Find them and cut their arms off. No mercy.
non-toxic,"Why do you keep posting an opinion piece written by a blathering idiot?  By the way, I'm not a pot head.  I prefer scotch.  The only reason that you see more people who do hard drugs have also used marijuana is that it is illegal.  That is the draw for some people.  Make it legal and it looses some of its luster.  Why do you suppose that many people that abuse alcohol also abuse prescription medication?  Is alcohol a gate way to pill popping?  I's exercise a gateway to steroids?"
non-toxic,"are you ILLITERATE, chuck?"
toxic,"Turn off the 'boob tube' and the blaring will stop. Put down the hooch and go do something productive and/or enjoyable(constant moaning about the state of the world accomplishes nothing). We generally create our own realities through our (in)actions(""Fat, drunk and stupid is no way to go through life, son."" -Dean Wormer)."
toxic,"No description of the perps so they must be black.

Half of media bias is what they omit."
toxic,"GW Bush did a years-long investigation under the Dept. of Justice and found effectively NO voter fraud. It cost a lot of money, and the Republican AG really thought he would find fraud, but it wasn't there. Do you think this investigation needs to be repeated every ten years, like the census? Just to keep the crazies happy? They won't buy the results anyway because they are SURE that DJ Trump is right about the three million illegals voting for Hillary. Garbage! Stupid people have stupid ideas, and the facts won't change their stupid minds."
toxic,What a ridiculous pile of bullshit.
toxic,"A good editorial that can be boiled down to one phrase made by Bill Clinton strategist, J Carville- ""It's the economy stupid""."
non-toxic,Spend money to save money.  Sounds like a damned TV commercial.
non-toxic,Obama has been an unmitigated disaster. The country cannot afford another one. Hillary is another one.
non-toxic,"""At this point, f*** you all,"" Ms. Khan responded. ""I stand by the motion I put forward. I stand by Indigenous students. … Be proud of this country? For what, over 400 years of genocide?"" She signed off with the hashtags #unlearn150, #whitefragilitycankissmyass and #yourwhitetearsarentsacredthislandis.""(c)
~ ~
What can be said about this ignorant woman... & the fact that she is using 'Indigenous' as a slick byline in order to spew her maladroit, racist garbage which can not get any more pathetic than her 'Look at me -- Look at me' superiority complex?

How this chick is being taken seriously* is simply beyond the pale.

There are many Indigenous Canadian Citizens who do not buy into this phony use of them to promote the 'Reba/Usery-Like-Agenda' of this ever-so-holy woman with the foul mouth.

Regardless of how the discussion of 'Cdn Indigenous Peoples' has been framed by the 'empty barrel' selfie-eager PM, JT, a great preponderance of the Cdn People love our Indigenous Cdns... Always."
non-toxic,Now you have a reason for that security detail. Suck on that bitch
non-toxic,Protesters are idiots and whiners- most don't know the facts and have nothig better to do - most are millenial pussies and clint correctly refers them - would they rather see another attack? They don't even know why they are there - kind of like publc workers and teachers
toxic,"Typical liberal response, anyone who has a different opinion is uneducated. Also the typical response of a coward, don't get face to face when you can throw insults from across the web."
non-toxic,"Re: ""The size of Inaugural crowds means nothing.""

Clearly (aka OBSERVABLY) it ""matters"" a great deal - to T-rump himself. HE is the one lying about it to try and bolster his own petulant, insatiable ego.

It seems that it is Trumplethinskin who is ""so arrogant"" as to NOT ""believe the truth"". Him and his Lugenvolksters."
toxic,"SB 21 is the cause of the budget crisis?  No, a decade of bi-partisan raiding of the bank is the cause.  A bunch of fools on the left and right who thought that oil-prices would never drop."
toxic,"ABSOLUTELY  pathetic, or, as Sheriff Andy Taylor of Mayberry would say: ""PITIFUL!""  The exaltation of recreational drug use is not progressive enlightenment, it's regressive individual and cultural stupidity.
From the time I was in high school in the '70s, people who used marijuana were LOSERS, potheads, dopers, now stoners and the like.  They were teenage losers then.  They are aging losers now, especially if getting high with their children is considered good in any way.  It's no wonder the city, state and country are in the sad state they are, with this kind of pathetic nonsense considered in a positive way.
Just one more time for emphasis: if you use marijuana recreationally, YOU ARE A LOSER>"
non-toxic,"Pro lifers have assassinated doctors
Christians are the terrorists"
toxic,"And I really hope a reporter has the stones to ask Donnie Two Scoops if he's afraid to call out ONLY the derplorables because he is concerned his support will erode even further?

Playing the BothSiderist card in this cagey manner only fuels the fire raging on the right. Trump is a fool if he thinks he'd be able to contain that if they got out of control. They would likely come for his family for being ""race traitors"", and even him for not being sufficiently purist to their stupid knuckle dragging ""cause"". 


Sidling up to murderous people with thoughts of terrorism on their minds will not have good outcomes."
non-toxic,"You sound like a man whose brain is filled with rock!!!  LOLOL  ""rimrock' what a perfect name for you!
your parent must be filled with rock to name their son 'rimrock', pathetic!!!"
non-toxic,"""You are being sexist, Margaret...""
I agree and with comments like 
"" “dark” personality traits... far more common in men"" and
""more men ... are hardwired to be twisted losers""
the whole article feels to me like one big troll."
non-toxic,"The penis (alleged) touching allegedly happened almost 50 years ago, only to ""go public"" just before an election of the man allegedly charged with such action. Interesting timing."
toxic,"This premise of this article is sexist. I'm disappointed, these old tropes (""How will she manage work and family?"") are tired, unoriginal, and Catherine McKenna deserves so much more."
non-toxic,"Anything negative involving the 2nd Amendment, showing support for abortion, treating gays as equal citizens, or treating Muslims the same way, other than that, they would support him even if he decided to round up political undesirables and jail them."
non-toxic,"The political left - and the MSM - have no faith in Trump at all, but then they never did.

I don't believe that the people who voted Trump into office are unhappy with him in the least.

But the political left has been sidelined - crying & stamping their little feet in impotent rage - nothing more than ""special snowflakes"", melting in the sun...

Suck it up and deal with it.

Or not."
non-toxic,People should sue those government bastards...our kids are drinking that water!
toxic,"If you are willing to hold onto a losing investment for 30 years, then you are either stupid or dumb. There are a lot more accretive things to invest in other than TO housing."
non-toxic,Unreal the imbeciles are more concerned about the wall that Mexico is supposed to pay for than health care. It's the spoiled brat syndrome. Break every toy and keep on moving to the next one because they're so rich that they use twenty dollar bills for toilet paper.
toxic,Ban Americans from every country. they seem to insist on doing stupid things abroad because of their cocky self appointed American entitlement
toxic,What a truly useless country and being supported by an ex East German bumbler who is leading socialist Europe as the Hamelin piper did.
toxic,"Cris, please don't believe everything I say. I don't. I am civil. I did not say intelligent, accurate, correct and more reliable than a slug."
toxic,"This is what Trump needs to do, ignore the Libs, & proceed to fulfill his promises he made during his campaign, this is why he was elected. Enough dealing with the fake news. Takes up to much time & money, just a waste to deal with.
Time for Republicans to step forward & over ride out these idiots."
toxic,What about the idiot haters?
non-toxic,Trump can grab my pussy anytime!
non-toxic,"This joker - and his ever-shifting team of motley fools - have only been in power for less than a month, and they've already told so many lies they can't keep them straight."
non-toxic,hahaha Yeah we dont do dumb ass shit like this....we are real criminals who help the economy that these citizens suck dry.
non-toxic,We are extremely lucky that Kim Jong Un is not Muslim. So the chance he will blow himself up  (by attacking Hawaii) is very small.
toxic,liam your an idiot
toxic,I agree. My blood pressure is up - and to read the petty comments of some does not help. These Zuptas need to f-off and leave is all alone. Hell is indeed waiting for them bastards.
toxic,"Donald Trump is far from a failed businessman, what a stupid uneducated argument."
non-toxic,"But isn't that the default setting of most Trump supporters? As soon as anyone points out his idiocy, or any of the criminal things he is purported to have done, they yell ""But Hillary was worse"", as if that makes any difference.
For a bunch that continually remind all the Trump haters that 'he won, she lost', they sure act a lot of the time like she won and was occupying the most powerful political position in the world, and should thus be subject to the intense media scrutiny that is currently being placed upon their hero.
What they don't seem to understand is that Hillary being bad is something that should only matter to US citizens and their courts. On the other hand, Trump being bad is dangerous to the whole world..."
non-toxic,"North America is screwed up with incompetent leaders as the USA has Trump and Canada has Trudeau, I think that says it all!"
non-toxic,Spare me Kellyanne Conway playing the victim.  Of course violence is never justified.  But she is not reviled for being a conservative.  She is hated for being an apologetic liar and her ridiculous spin in support of every falsehood Donald Trump spiels.
toxic,Has this pathetic parasite ever spent a day governing?
toxic,It is too bad for the families of the people it happens to.  But I like to think of some of the occurrences as natural selection.  Only a complete moron would take the risks and do some of the things we read about.
non-toxic,"chris was my friend for 15+ years. He rode with me daily for many many years. your right. the truth should be known. 
apparently murder is really easy these days. 
i highly doubt chris fell in and drowned. he swam great. He had been thru alot and never died before? wtf happened that night? he lost his mind and forgot how to swim.. no... not hardly.  this was done to chris.. this wasnt no damn accident"
toxic,Charlottesville plain and simple was one group itching for a fight and another group dumb enough to give them one. Where was Trump Wrong?
non-toxic,"Democrats, Republicans, or Trump - you can blame anyone or no one, but you're still going to get a crap deal."
non-toxic,"Flagged potty mouth, Go Trump!"
toxic,"I have nothing  against Obama but really  there are way more important things the state  legislators  should be  focusing on. Why do they always stupid sh!t why. Getting off subject a little, but who in their right mind wants or would want to legalize  prostitution another stupid

Scammers come and falsely represent themselves. 

 Ain't that the truth.


Friends and family don't allow friends and family to fall for scammers.

non-toxic,"Why don't PC fascist like yourself not go and create a redoubt of like minded leftist?

toxic,"keep living in your left wing stupidity, there will be a market for our OIL from the SANDS  for generations"
toxic,Hookipa.  This total bullshit!  The Hawaiians are protesting to get the Aina back to there hands and the Legislators are doing the exact opposite. We're just inviting trouble like the mainland and Europe with the Jihadists.  As long as the Legislators aren't being harmed everything is Pono.
toxic,The only people more stupid than these pathetic clowns are you idiots who keep buying the drugs they sell. You buyers are the root of the problem. Period.
non-toxic,"What a worthless piece of s...t you are! Hurry, check your toilet, maybe it's already full."
non-toxic,"What a waste of time and taxpayer money. These fools will choose whoever Shopo tells Caldwell to have them pick. There's only 2 independent commissioners and they'll get out voted by sheep.
Without a doubt, it'll be someone from within HPD. Someone the union can run like Kealoha, a good ole boy."
non-toxic,"aa wente, get over your hate for trump, its old and pathetic"
toxic,"The dispensary  model has been a disaster thus far.  Frequent holdups, adulterated product, and no thought to opening in a suitable location.

The plan for dedicated stores rather than using the LCBO is, like, stupid, but I have more faith in government to do this properly than I do the private sector."

toxic,"The morons just can't stop stealing from people. In Canada, up to certain amount of income, we have to give almost 50% of our income to the morons. And for the rest 50% that we keep in our pocket, when we spend it again we have to give 12-15% (gst) to the morons. So basically we are left with 35% of what we earn. And these are still not enough, they work very hard to invent a way to dig more from our pocket. From car insurance to property tax, medical to transportation, EVERYTHING INCREASED since the Liberal took over. Let's fight back, let's start from voting out the Liberal (NDP is another moron too), then next let's vote out Bicycle Greg."
toxic,You're an idiot
non-toxic,"Please don't get a flu shot Dennis, we need to thin out the herd and get rid of the morons."
non-toxic,"Probably another ""mentally ill"" person too ill to go to trial.  There used to be institutions for people like him.   Saved a ton of taxpayer money bulldozing them, didn't you now?  The best intervention is rendering the person incapable of resistance.  Those three men learned you don't talk down racists and bigots.   Sorry for their families and friends."
non-toxic,So you have no problem with Trumps behavior. I'd love to see how you react when someone introduces himself by grabbing your genitals.
non-toxic,"It's a coming Canada. NK will

toxic,Only a total idiot would vote for Clinton.
non-toxic,"Should read : this moron beneath the office of the President, he needs to GO!!"
non-toxic,"You proved my initial point about fools and right-wingers with your post.
Why would Trump confront Putin if he believed the allegations are baseless?

non-toxic,It's only February but.... The dumbest trade of the year goes to.... THE OTTAWA SENATORS!!!
non-toxic,"I have read it a million times that Trump’s voters are racists, ignorant and sexists.  It is standard leftist lingo when they describe anyone with a viewpoint that challenges their own.  Calling out liars, who have been demeaning ordinary Americans without a political champion to stand up for them, has made Trump their hero.  I often disagree with the President but I love the way he fights the left.  They are mud throwers and Trump knows how to push their faces flat into the mire."
toxic,"Stupidity is not a crime.  President Trump, you are free to go."
non-toxic,"Really? Are you talking about Senator Al Franken the distinguished member from Minnesota that has been particularly involved with helping vets?
Are you that delusional or did you have a bowl of Carnation instant Bee itch this morning?
Jeff Sessions is a pathetic little racist who is evil incarnate."
non-toxic,"Sounds like a horrific case of stupidity. If you're sweltering inside a hot truck in the parking lot of a big store, um, maybe you can assume the store is air conditioned and go inside and pretend to be a shopper? Unless these ding-dongs thought that there's some kind of security clearance at the entrance of Walmart where they check to see if you're a U.S. citizen? I can't believe out of 30 people, nobody had any money to purchase beverages? They could have gone into the store A FEW AT A TIME every several minutes so as to not arouse suspicion, just to cool down. What the devil were they thinking? That Walmart checks for green cards?"
non-toxic,"Another Romney, eh?  Creatures keep crawling out of the swamp."
toxic,"here we go again....hot dog drivers think they have no rules. flying around corners at full speed, tailgating, speeding, drunk, high, and just plain ol stupid. if you are going to drive, grow up first."
toxic,"Would your family drop $200K on you if you needed it? Really, what a stupid reply."
non-toxic,shame on the gutless cops for caving in to BLM...shame on Pride for signing all the demands in last years parade..it seems that Black gays are more important and entitled then non-black gays

toxic,"I reiterate, your ignorance is profound, and why you make ignorant deluded statements like Reagan killed the unions. In the real world, what killed the unions, is the fact so many had been taken over by organized crime.
 To further address your ignorance; before every hire in my lifetime, I negotiated my own wages, and benefits just fine. Furthermore, my Chickasaw mother, ran the medical offices of Reynolds Metals, and the Port of Portland, both of which are union. My mother was non-union, and managed to negotiate better wages, and benefits than the union workers she took care of when they injured themselves on the job. The only people I know who need a union to attain better wages are slackers who let people like me carry their load. People like me always can negotiate better wages our labor produces more than slackers."

non-toxic,"I love all the hate you are bringing to this. If you stop and take a minute to look at facts, Look at what other states have done and charge you will see that this probably won't make it till Christmas. First we are 3 times the price of anywhere else. Second they can't keep it on the shelf. Last, Every other state had a up and running medical system in place and working great and then brought the rest in. Alaska has said F-YOU to ALL medical even though they have been giving out medical cards like they were candy for 20 years but never had a place to get anything not even a seed. Now you want a criminal, Look no farther than the white house. He brags about abusing women and walking in on naked teenage girls. In most states and FEDERALLY that is a FELONY. When the drunk goes through the stop sign and kills a family, Remember the stoner is still waiting for the sign to turn green."
non-toxic,"The liberals are starting to remind me of the pigs from the novel, Animal Farm."
toxic,"Cap and Trade is a (corrupt) shell game designed to allow politicians to escape real scrutiny of results. There is no simple, honest, straightforward measure that tells you it is succeeding or failing in its murky and vague objectives; it is always full of uncertainties and unreliable assumptions. There is alway plenty of room for rhetoric to make it entirely opaque and we see that with the BS coming from ministers trying to explain it in this column and elsewhere. This is one of those times when I feel like I am from the stupid province and that the West got it right (outside of dumb old Saskatchewan with its ""Wall"" against progress) with straightforward taxes (who can try to manipulate that, but you will be decisively found out). Picking such an impenetrable method of government involvement in promoting solutions to climate change is one HUGE reason to distrust Wynne and is indicative of her manipulative nature."
toxic,"Most ignorant post of the season. ""Worst Offenses in Baseball""  really why is it they rank 6th in offense for entire MLB? and 4th in the NL.  You pick out one pitcher that has the Rockies number, happens to every team, one pitcher seems to pitch and match up well against a team. Means nothing.  Every team goes through a hitting slump, you look at past years performance and you know this team can hit.  It is the pitching that is questionable for the entire season, Rookies and facing batters multiple times is the issue, you think you know more than Bud Black? Please, its well established, hitters facing pitchers more times read them better and do better."

non-toxic,"Well, Trump caught a wave, as it were, but I'm not sure I credit him with street smarts -- he leaves the street fighting to hired hands. He's a classic bully -- a blowhard in the abstract, a coward in concrete cases (such as the meeting with the Mexican president.) Republicans and conservatives who detested him a year ago have embraced him now because they think he will sign anything they send him; and he will, for a while at least, because he doesn't really believe in anything or care about any of it. However, I take your point; his supporters appear oblivious to his defects of character, personality and judgment; Trump's genius, if he has any, is he recognizes that and plays them for fools.
I reluctantly credit Trump with emasculating Romney. He invited Romney to dinner and served 'Testicules de Romney'."
toxic,"All he had to say was something about Washington swamp is full of Democrats and Trump's supporters had to fly in, so of course there were less of them than for Obama.

toxic,Why are you so stupid.
toxic,"I am startled by the assertion that 50% of the American voters are just plain stupid.  so, say we compare the alleged stupidity of the American voter with the alleged stupidity of the Canadian voter (you just ask anyone involved in a rant about the unfair and completely stupid victory of the Liberal party in the last Canadian federal election: how stupid are Canadian voters if you thought 'the other party' should have won) - how does Canada compare?  Then, would you be prepared to offer up some kind of 'voter stupidity' measure, whereby we evaluate voter stupidity on some kind of international scale in order to identify 'smart outcomes of an election' VS 'stupid outcomes caused by stupid voters'?  Such a measure might be useful to politicians hoping to win in spite of voter stupidity and it might encourage tactics encouraging the stupid voters to just never mind voting because their stupid voting just gets in the way of the smart outcome.  OR, we all get one vote, stupid or not."

a) there are very few problems caused by cannabis and very many problems caused by cannabis prohibition;
b) ""pot people"" will obey the law when the law obeys them and not before;
c) cannabis is not terrible, nor is it a gateway drug, as has been proven again and again and as I am sure you well know (because you're probably a troll);
d) murder for cannabis is a black market thing so that is an argument FOR re-legalization not for prohibition;
e) cannabis has been documented to provide numerous health benefits and it has many healing properties, which I am sure you also already know (because now I'm really sure you're a troll);"

I dont think anyone would be making this big a deal out of this if he wouldnt have said anything about making the taxes ""fair"" with all the new proposed tax changes. Everyone knows this stuff happens and it always will. If he would think before he opens his mouth perhaps people wouldnt think hes such a twit. When he goes on about fairness and then this comes out he looks silly. If he would have left everything the same and this came out, not quite the same reaction.

toxic,"NHL sucks.  They are fixing these games so bad.  Nashville knocked the net off and the puck went in.  That is a goal & the player needs 10 min. misconduct.  Blatant cheating.  I saw refs blocking players kicking the puck in their skates, failing to get out of the way.  NHL cheating is such bullshit.  Letting Nashville off the hook for the fight - its 5 and a game.  Then they started running the goalie.  Its a game misconduct for the Nashville coach for doing that.  Shall I go on?  As soon as the team they want (NASHVILLE) fell behind the refs got real busy into fixing mode.  NHL proves it cant put on a fair game.
Its crooked bullshit hockey.  Overdosing on the lights.  You can get an epileptic fit just watching even if youre not epileptic.  NHL proves every game how cheating is THEIR game.  Randy Carlisle could hardly talk there was so much cheating.  USA-RUSSIA no tv here.  We are ashamed of our team.  Its pitiful.  NO LIVE USA games.  OUR TV IS 100% propaganda.  BAD? it is beyond bad"

The majority of these bombers became radicalized after they visited their Muslim countries. We know this. We have documented proof. We know what the common denominator is and yet we turn a blind eye and pretend we can't say these things because it isn't PC. We say that religious freedom is American. We ENCOURAGE Muslims to live in this country, we encourage them to build mosques. We encourage them to wear their traditional clothes in which our OUR military says they NEVER KNOW if anyone in a burka is a WOMAN or carrying RPG's and BOMBS!! How stupid we Americans are.

If the speech is important enough, as this one probably was seen to be, key cabinet and deputy ministers may also input and review the speech.  As a former drama student and drama teacher, Justin's one talent is delivery and he sounds like he actually knows what he is talking about.  If only it were so!  Oh well, he fooled you.

I am baffled as to how any rational person could contend that The Doltish, Dimpled, Dilettantish Dauphin from 24 Sucks Us Dry has the common touch while actual folks born, raised and remaining part of the middle class like Scheer and Rempel do not.  Perhaps it takes a special kind of stupid."

They will also tell you they can't get you to your appointment at the time you require.  Instead you can go 2 hours earlier or an hour later.Finances are another consideration.  It costs $3.50 for a one-way ride on Anchor Rides.  As to exercise, and lifestyles, most of us seniors can't afford a cheeseburger or cable TV, and I get a minimum of 1 mile a day of walking in just going to the bus stop.

This means that the odds of anyone having a hate crime committed against them are extremely rare. We don't need a government motion (with attached government spending - wasteful!) to condemn Islamophobia (a vague and politically malleable term.)

We deserve the right to criticize Islam. Islam is not only a religion, its a political movement. And all Canadians should strive against the political arm of Islam. We don't want another Rotherham here in Canada due to hate speech laws.

When Imams constantly preach death for those who leave Islam, and the pratice of Taqqiya (lying to non-Muslims) is encourage, and women get stoned to death for getting raped, and gay people get executed just for being gay, then Islamophobia makes sense.

non-toxic,The bottom line is that it's pathetic that rather than solve the houseless crisis they resort to mean-spirited harassment instead.  Maybe they should have a safe place where they can live and get the help they need to get back on their feet.

non-toxic,"An irrational person (criminal/mentally ill) can use anything to justify criminal or anti-social behavior.  The media jumping on an innocent comment and warping it simply provides more opportunity for irrational people to latch on to something.  The Dallas police murderer, Orlando night club murderer, abortion doc murderer, and as you referred, a long sad history of irrational people doing what they want.  There will always be whack jobs who do whatever they want.  Trump's comments were in no way meant to incite violence and to say so is simply playing the outrage card and does nothing to promote civil discourse.  Twisting comments to make political hay is disgusting and intellectually dishonest."

I am not anti anything, except when someone is out there pointing their fingers and spewing bigoted assumptions as though they are facts. 

I don't make posts like ""haha stupid inbred conservatives can't read that's why they elected Trump!"" In fact I've been quick to accept corrections and freely admit agreement.

You're the one saying: ""Stupid snowflakes, Liberalism is a mental disorder"" any chance you get.

The success of a tax is if it is widespread, can be enforced easily and is paid by those who actually purchase goods and services. 
The fewer collectors of a tax the better, and there are much fewer businesses to collect a sales tax than there are residents, who may or may not honestly pay an income tax There are a LOT of income tax cheaters and to enforce collection of income tax requires a new State agency. 
Auditing businesses who collect sales tax is very straightforward and very few businesses of any size cheat on sales taxes. 
As a person increases their income, they buy more expensive items, therefore they pay more sales tax, Most states eliminate groceries from sales tax, so as to not unfairly hit the poor, so the sales tax is on items people CHOOSE to buy. Rich people buy planes, expensive cars, expensive homes, expensive ""toys"", remodel homes, buy new appliances, etc. and therefore pay more sales tax."

So, take existing assets that generate revenue, or COULD generate revenue (e.g. currently non-toll bridges, roads, etc.) and sell them to the private sector.  Junior gets more money to burn NOW, while the corresponding loss to the public is in the FUTURE (either public revenue now going to the new private owner, or fees/tolls to be paid on something that would have been toll-free, because it was paid for {e.g.Coquhalla in BC}).

non-toxic,"I maintain that Donald Trump doesn't really mean it when he denies the science behind the assertion that global warming is real and that it is man-made. We already know the man is a serial liar. I think  he's lying about this because his real interest is in lining the pockets of his billionaire buddies in the oil and gas industry, and if he were to come right out and admit that it would be seen as too crass, even for him. So he lies and claims he doesn't believe the science, which sounds more legit.

What I don't get is all the ""family values"" people who are always the first to chime in with ""but what about the children?"" not caring about climate change now. It's clear to me as a gay person that ""family values"" only ever meant ""no homo,"" but still, you'd think that conservatives really would care about the world they're leaving their children.

Wrong again, Larry. People were called ignorant for being ignorant, and spreading false information taken from alt right websites without ever considering fact checking before parroting. (They should be called alt wrong websites.)

People were called racist for making racist comments, which of course were simply considered anti PC remarks by the racists. That's the racist way of being PC, ironic as that is, and it kind of brings us back to the ignorance thing, again.

Calling someone a Nazi who has ideals that align perfectly with Nazi ideals is simply a reflection on that persons belief systems.

This is not Canada ...with a bunch of « Loyalists » Orangemen.

After the establishment of the Canadian Federation (1867), the English speaking several provinces attended helplessly to the adoption of several LAWS and regulations, anti-Catholic and anti-French in English Canada, especially in that regard to denominational schools outside Québec.
Anti-Catholic and anti-French attitude drew its source, among others, the fact that many of the Loyalists who came to Québec after the American Revolution of 1775 (Eastern Townships/ Ontario and Western Provinces) were ""Orangemen"" convinced.  Orangemen advocated an anti-Catholic and anti-French doctrine, inspired by the reconquest of England in 1690 by the Protestant Prince William III of Orange.…

Still, Trump has to go. He's a vulgar thug, a career criminal, who folded his family and family business into the executive office of the president in order to advance the fortunes of Donald J. Trump. At one time, I thought he would and should resign; I no longer think that. I think it best, even imperative, that he face the impeachment process. That process is both political and judicial, and it necessarily involves a full explication of the evidence, and provides for the president's right to mount an aggressive defense. If he survives that process, then so be it; but if he is removed, it is utterly important for the evidence against him be laid out for the people of the United States and the world to see.
As candidate and as president, Trump has expressed his contempt for the American people, their government and their institutions. We must reassure ourselves and the rest of the world that our Constitution endures, that it works, that it can deal with Donald Trump."

That's why I have to laugh at Trump's supporters who swallowed hook, line and sinker every lie, even if proven false, about Hillary Clinton.  The child rape accusation was actually a scheduled court case which was withdrawn because the victim received death threats.  Trump is a man who has admitted he sexually assaults women, has boasted about his promiscuity.  He and our new first lady were recorded on the Howard Stern Show, while they were not yet married to each other, and both of them admitted that they were naked and had just had sex.

Spicer didn't lie to press corps, they were the liars and lied again all day today (and Doyle swallowed it all). Spicer was asked to remain as Press Secretary by Scaramucci but resigned, having been passed over for Comms Director job. He would be far better returning to his old job as GOP congressional comms director, but can make much more money going forward as a corporate comms director or a talking head on TV.

Just because well foundationed, rational and justifiable description doesn't fit into your fantasies of a world actually ruled by Trump, doesn't mean they aren't well foundationed, rational and justifiable.

One defintion of idiot in the Merriam-Webster Dictionary is:

""a foolish or stupid person""

So, relative to firing Comey, Trump was both stupid and foolish.  Evidence?  Mueller, Bannon and general ongoing controversy.

Relative to new smear campaign against Comey?  Stupid and foolish.  The talkiing points miss the pint, but more importantly, they re-raise how stupid and foolish he was to fire Comey in the first place.  Lester Holt's interview gets more views on Youtube.

Plus, just overall, he's stupid and foolish.  So, idiot.  And, also idiotic.  For his idiotness (A word?  You can criticize if not)."

Where sleeping your way to the top, and the casting couch was what it was.  You might not know it but Muslims have been killing each other for a thousand years because each other sees the other as an infidel, worthy only of death. Now they are targeting Europe, who gave them refuge. Now they are targeting us as well. You probably don't even know what  Taqiyya is.  But if Hillary had won, we would be in serious trouble. The millions of unveiled immigrants would be infiltrated by as much as 10- 20%. We're talking hundreds of thousands fundamentalist Muslims who want to get to paradise and be rewarded with 100 virgins.But lets say only 1000 got thru & killed 5 apiece. Is that acceptable?"

non-toxic,The real threat to your future lifestyle is the growing debt combined with incomes and the work force growing more and more slowly.

Think of that next time you voice your support for more government giveaways - there no such thing as a free lunch.  And there aren't enough rich people that you can tax to pay for it.  It will eventually come out of your (and your children's) bank accounts.  Despite what idiots like Krugman think.

non-toxic,One of the things I find most disturbing about trump followers is their (and your) refusal to recognize how much he lies.  Or do you not care?  Maybe you've become inured to his lying?  Even more apalling is the hypocritical support offered him by conservative evangelicals.  That is truly sad!
non-toxic,Right....  she (and you) would've been so happy and appreciative if the books would've come from Hillary or obama.

non-toxic,"The treatment of the Rohingya Muslims in Myanmar is terrible. Still, it is not difficult to understand why the people of Myanmar want these people out. The Rohingyas cling to a detestable belief that Muslims has an obligation to spread the pure nonsense of Islam to all corners of the world. Without any form of evidence their faith claims that God prefers women to be covered up and kept under strict control. God does not favor men on men, Christians or just about anybody not Muslim. Per the Koran it is okay to kill them all; especially Jews. 

The problem with the Rohingya Muslims, sometimes referred to as the most prosecuted people on earth, has a 
rather obvious solution; they can abandon Islam. 

Of course, this is an impossible task as they have all been indoctrinated in the terrible cult from birth.  They prefer the constant oppression, rape and murder of their people for the simple reason that they lost their capacity for rational thinking."

BTW, that original ""news"" story, was never even remotely corroborated, before repeated, as plain fact.
Worse still, they spin doctors didn't tell Trump.  Being the conspiracy nut with a twitter account that he is, he swallowed his own teams lie, and then made their pin hole, hoping to deflate the Russian scandal, into a huge tear into the fabric of reality.  
The result?  It is not beyond reason that this will result in his being injected into the investigation underway, the very thing the Dems have been fighting for, and Trump has, as the fool he is, now demanded.

non-toxic,"This crap is getting old.  I guess Trump's elementary school teacher will come out next saying he groped her also back in 1947 but she also wasn't bright enough to report it.   Wait until Chillary brings over her 300,000 Syrian immigrants and see how many women get forcefully groped.  I guess Germany has been finding out already."

I see most if not all, are christians all claiming to be deeply committed to their white mans jesus teachings that is a prerequisite for office. But our corrupt Tammany Hall in Washington is causing suffering and death instead of helping.
So where do their supposedly christian souls go when they die, after causing pain and misery, How about their supporters souls? They forgot jesus was a refugee and helped the less fortunate, the sick, weak, diseased, infirm, hungry and dying instead of preying on them like parasites. Them going to heaven make as much sense as the jihadi terrorists murdering innocents and expecting to go to their Islamic heaven with 72 virgins"

That's not where it starts in most cases like this.
It starts with an individual breaking the law.
Then police are called.
It then proceeds to said individual threatening police after they engage him/her.
From there it follows basic police procedure.

It's simple really. 

Hundreds of people interact with police officers on a daily basis and make good decisions and wake up the next morning.
A few don't."

I'm sure all the Presidents in my life sought and probably overused their privilage in some way.    But Trump is an intolerent uncivil bully who takes pathological pleasure in demeaning others.

Trump is not normal or typical, thank god, of the character of our past 10 presidents (including those I strongly disagreed with).

non-toxic,"The robot censor seems disinclined to accept some harsh truths, but let's try again:

Why is it that despite 70% of serial killers and 80-90% of child molesters and mass-shooters being white, most white Americans are fixated on BLACK crime?  Perhaps its related to a long-perpetuated double-standard that when black or brown (or Muslim) criminals commit crimes, it's held up as a reflection on their entire communities, whereas when white criminals do so, it's only a reflection on said criminals themselves.  And that in turn seems predicated on a widely held and nearly as frequently denied assumption that was first voiced by satan, when his Creator demanded he explain why he refused to make humble himself before 'Adam as he was commanded: ""Anna khairum min'hum--I'm BETTER than him."" (Qur'an, Suratul-A'raf, Ayaa 11-12)"
